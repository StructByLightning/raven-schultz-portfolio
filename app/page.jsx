      <p>I took on the challenge of designing SymbyAI&apos;s automated peer review platform. Scientific peer review is a notoriously complex process, but thanks to modern design techniques, I was able to streamline it into a set of four intuitive pages. And to explain how their cutting-edge AI works, I created a ten-second hero animation for the homepage. The SymbyAI team loved my designs so much that they hired me full-time to build their frontend.</p>

  {
    name: "Immersive Audio Album",

      <p>I crafted a completely new interface for this immersive music marketplace, building everything from custom audio visualizers to an intuitive preview system. By focusing on the unique needs of audio artists, the new design resonated so well it boosted traffic by 40% and caught the attention of major music labels who previously wouldn&apos;t give us the time of day.</p>

  {
    name: "X Marks the Site",
    body: <>
      <p>I built an scavenger hunt puzzle game that became the cornerstone of a major marketing campaign. Using Next.js and GSAP, I created fluid animations and game mechanics that kept 80,000+ players engaged. The challenge of making it both fun and technically robust was incredibly satisfying - especially when we saw players sharing their victories on social media.</p>

  {
    name: "The Guild of the ROSE",
    body: <>
      <p>This was my favorite kind of challenge: building something complex that looks simple. I created a full-stack community platform with a custom Canvas-based skill tree (think RPG-style character progression), integrated Stripe payments, and a content management system. It&apos;s been used by 2,000+ users who to track their real-life improvement at everything from social skills to advanced memorization techniques.</p>

    name: "Deviate Labs",

      <p>I transformed this corporate site from basic HTML into a modern Next.js powerhouse. The fun part was building a library of reusable animations, components, and CSS classes that made creating new pages feel like playing with LEGOs. The system was so efficient it cut development time by 40% while making everything load 10% faster.</p>

      <p>This analytics platform minimum viable product needed both technical stability and intuitive design. I rebuilt it from scratch, focusing on a streamlined landing page and rock-steady backend to process user requests. The best part? Support tickets dropped by 90% because users could finally find what they needed without asking for help. It&apos;s satisfying when good design solves real problems.</p>

              <p>I&apos;m a hybrid designer-developer who loves creating exceptional digital experiences. While most people are either designers or developers, I&apos;ve always been both - I get equally excited about perfecting a color palette and optimizing React page load times. This combination of technical expertise and strong design sensibility lets me build entire websites from scratch, handling  everything from initial Figma sketches to final AWS deployment.</p>

              <p>My coding journey started with making simple games in elementary school, evolved into building bots in high school (including a network of six game bots running in my garage!), and finally led to web development in college. These days, I pour that same enthusiasm into creating  websites that are both beautiful and blazing fast.</p>

              <p>I especially love working on complex animations and interactions - the kind that make users go &quot;wow, how did they do that?&quot; Whether it&apos;s morphing SVG paths, crafting pixel-perfect interfaces, or optimizing performance, I&apos;m always pushing to make things better and more interesting.</p>
